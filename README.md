I'm a physics student currently living and studying in Stuttgart with research experience in the field of machine learning. You can read more about my previous research in my [BachelorThesis](https://github.com/ma-sauter/BachelorsThesis/blob/fd76ca689ef2c40fe56ad547bd89e4352719c5ca/main.pdf).

In the future I aspire to pursue a career in theoretical physics and want to contribute to our understanding of the fundamental workings behind the universe.
